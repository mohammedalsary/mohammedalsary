I've always been into business and marketing. Whether targeting pain points, understanding the company's strengths, or even just making sense of excel sheets with over 2500+ entries, I've always found it fascinating seeing how businesses go from something to nothing.

Over my time at university, I've developed a skillset that always me to take datasets from various disciplines and make sense of them. This led me to merging the two worlds and starting a project on a dealerships sales data I got off of Kaggle.

The goal was simple: Take the dataset, clean it up, and make sense of it. I wanted to see how well I could not only apply my technical skills, but my intellectual skills as well (this includes analysis, insight derivation, etc.).

I first started off with the tool I'm the most comfortable with, R.
